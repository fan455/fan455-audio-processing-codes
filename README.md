# fan455-audio-processing-codes
The audio processing codes I wrote for python.

Required python packages: numpy, scipy, matplotlib, soundfile.

Please note that the shape of an audio array as Soundfile uses: (number_of_samples, number_of_channels) while some libraries like librosa uses the reverse shape.
